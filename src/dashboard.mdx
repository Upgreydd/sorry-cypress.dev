The ReactJS web dashboard uses [API services](/api) to display the test results and currently running tests. You can browse test details and failure messages.

When a [Storage driver](/director/storage) is configured, you can also see screenshots and video recordings (if enabled).

## Configuration

Set the environment variable `GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_URL` with the URL of [API service](/api).
GraphQL client will use it to pull schema definitions and issue queries.

```sh
GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_URL='https://sorry-cypress-demo-api.herokuapp.com'
```

You can explore an example dashboard at https://sorry-cypress-demo.herokuapp.com/.

## Running the service

```sh
$ cd packages/dashboard

$ npm install
$ npm run build
...
$ npm run start

$ node ./server

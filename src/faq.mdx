## Why?

I was upset because:

- dashboard crashes and blocks my tests
- parallelization stops working after paid plan has reached its limit
- no on-prem solution from the official cypress

## Is it legal?

Yes, Cypress is an [MIT licensed open source software](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/LICENSE).

## Is it production-ready?

Yes. Have been used by dozens of companies around the globe.

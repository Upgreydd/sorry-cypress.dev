## In-memory

Keeps the state of runs in-memory. That means that restarting the service wipes everything.

That's the simplest and most naive implementation.

If you just want to run the tests in parallel and not worry about storing test results.

## Persisting MongoDB

The state - test runs and results - are persisted in MongoDB. The [API service](/api) queries MongoDB the retreive test run details when using [Dashboard](/dashboard).

To enable this driver, set the envrionment variables:

```
EXECUTION_DRIVER="../execution/mongo/driver"
MONGODB_URI="monodgb://your-DB-URI"
MONGODB_DATABASE="your-DB-name"
```

With MongoDB driver you can use the other services - `api` and `dashboard` to browse the results of your test runs.

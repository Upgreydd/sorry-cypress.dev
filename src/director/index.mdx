## Overview

The `director` service is responsible for:

- paralellization and coordination of test runs
- saving tests results
- saving failed tests screenshots

When you launch Cypress on a CI environment with multiple machines, each machine first contacts the dashboard to get the next test to run.

The dashboard coordinates the requests from different machines and assigns tests to each.

## Starting the service

```sh
cd packages/director

npm install
npm run build
npm run start

# ...

Initializing "in-memory" execution driver...
Initializing "dummy" screenshots driver...
Listening on 1234...
```

By default, the service will run on port `1234` with `in-memory` execution driver and `dummy` storage driver.

## Drivers

The `director` uses "drivers" that define different aspects of its functionality. You can choose or implement different type of drivers to support the desired functionality. There're several community-supported drivers listed below.

## Configuration

The service uses [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package. To change the default configuration, create `.env` file in service's root to set the default environment variables:

```sh
$ pwd
/Users/agoldis/sorry-cypress/packages/director

$ cat .env

PORT=1234

# DASHBOARD_URL is what Cypress client shows as a "Run URL"
DASHBOARD_URL="https://sorry-cypress.herokuapp.com"

# Path the the execution driver
EXECUTION_DRIVER="../execution/in-memory"

# Path the the storage driver
SCREENSHOTS_DRIVER="../screenshots/dummy.driver"

# Read more about record keys whitelist below
ALLOWED_KEYS="my_secret_key,my_another_secret_key"
```

Setting `ALLOWED_KEYS` variable allows you to define list of comma delimited record keys (provided to the Cypress Runner using `--key` option) which are accepted by the `director` service. This can be useful when Cypress is running on external CI servers and we need to expose `director` to the internet.

Empty or not provided variable means that all record keys are allowed.

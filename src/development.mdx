## Setup

The project uses [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/). Install dependecies by running `yarn` in the root directory.

## Services Development

Use different terminals to run each package in `watch` mode.

```
yarn dev
```

## Using docker-compose

The project uses `docker-compose` to conveniently run backend services in dockerized containers, during development as well.

It is recommended to use `docker-compose` to run the backend services (`director` and `api`) in watch mode.

The `dashboard` is less convenient to develop in a docker, it is more effective to run it on host machine.

- Run `docker-compose build` from the project's root directory
- Run `docker-compose up` to start the services

The latter command will create 3 services:

- MongoDB instance on port `27017`
- `director` service on port `1234`
- `api` service on `4000`

You can change the configuration using the environment variables defined in `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Behind the scenes

API and Dashboard are straightforward GraphQL and ReactJS implementations. Director implements the next flow:

1. Each cypress agent (machine) sends the same initial request with:

- specs lists
- machine hardware details
- git commit details
- `--ci-build-id` and other CLI parameters

2. The `director` fetches (or creates a new ) `run` based on the parameters and responds with a randomly generated `machineId` and the `runId`.

3. Each cypress client requests a next available task for the `runId` which was returned previously

4. The service looks at the list of tests and returns next available test, marks the returned test as `claimed`

5. Cypress agent runs the test and reports the results to `director`

6. Director persists the results and return upload URLs for storing screenshots and videos.

7. When there're no more available tests, director returns an "empty" response - cypress agent halts execution
